# Shaders
#cs 

## What are they?

Programs used to calculate the color and light of a 3D scene.

## GPGPU

- General purpose computing on GPUs
- Use of GPU for computations generally handled by CPU
- GPGPU pipeline is parallel processing between many GPUs and CPUs to analyse graphics data
- Many cores


## Shader Types

Remember the graphics pipeline:
- Application -> Geometry -> Rasterization -> Screen


Types:
- 2D Shaders
	- Pixel Shaders
- 3D Shaders
	- Vertex Shaders
	- Geometry Shaders
	- Tessellation Shaders
	- Primitive and Mesh shaders
	- Raytracing Shaders

### Pixel Shaders
- Values: Color and alpha, depth


## FFP

- Fixed Function Pipeline
	- Hardcoded lighting and texturing
- Shaders are programmable 


## Shading Languages

- Languages to realize shading effects
- Vector, color, matrix, normal data types
