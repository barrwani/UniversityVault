# Physical Based Animation
#cs 


Animation of:
- Rigid bodies
- Deformables
- Fluids


#### Conventional Animation
- Interpolate values between keyframes
- Create function curves
- Non-interactive

#### Physically based
 - Physical laws apply
 - Real-time and interactive

Particles have mass, velocity, position, and applied forces
$F=ma$


## Particle Systems

- Time dependent phenomena
- Has mass, velocity, position, applied forces
- Can also carry color, lifetime, other rendering related attributes



## Rigid Bodies

- Ideal solid body with no deformation allowed
- Distance between mass points is constant under external forces
- Forces exerted to mass points translate/rotate entire body
