Unix is an Operating System developed in the 1960s.

Made up of the kernel, shell, and programs


Kernel:

Allocates time and memory to programs and handles the file store and communications in response to system calls


Shell:

The shell is an interface between the user and the kernel.

When a user logs in, the login program checks the username and password, and then starts another program called the shell.

The shell is a command line interpreter (CLI), It interprets the commands the user types in and arranges for them to be carried out.

`History` - the shell keeps a list of commands you have typed in. If you need to repeat a command, use the cursor (arrow) keys to scroll up and down the list or type history for a list of previous commands
