## Stack Smashing

Buffer overflow:
- If there is nothing checking for input size you can overflow the input buffer and access memory you shouldn't have access to

ROP: 
- Smash the stack with a bunch of return addresses 
- Each return address points to the needed instruction followed by 'ret' (this requires access to the binary)
