## Function Words VS Content Words


### Function Words

- Articles 'a', 'the'
- Prepositions 'in', 'of', 'on', 'at', 'up', 'until'
- Pronouns 'she', 'him', 'they', 'it'
- Auxiliary verbs 'be', 'did', 'are', 'is', 'has', etc.
- Complementizers, Conjunctions, etc.

Function words are a closed set. All of these words can be rounded up and listed, and they are almost never borrowed.


### Content Words

- Nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives

Content words are open class; new ones are borrowed and coined all the time. 



## Connected Speech

In connected speech, function words are given less phonetic importance. 

Content words usually receive at least one full stress, but function words would usually only receive stress if they are emphasised or focused. 

| Orthography | Strong | Weak   |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ |
| and         | ænd    | ən, n̩ |
| them        | ðɛm    | ɛm, m̩ |
| has         | hæz    | əz, z  |



#### Rules that apply between words

- If a stop follows a stressed vowel inside a word, the stop is aspirated. 
	- If the stop is word final it can be glottalized
	- Word-initial cannot be glottalized.


#### Sandhi
- External Sandhiː
	- Occurs at the boundaries between two words
	- Often occurs during casual or fast speech
	- Exː "Don't you" -> "Don'tcha"
		- \[doʊntju\] -> \[doʊntʃə]
		- \[tju] to \[tʃɘ] (t + j = tʃ)
	- Another common example is (s + j = ʃ)

- Internal Sandhiː
	- Occurs within words as a result of morphological processes
	-  Electric -> electricity.


#### Assimilation

Alveolar Nasals can become velar or labial to match the place of articulation of the following stops:
- n + k = ŋk
	- Seven cats = \[sɛvəŋkæts]
- n + b = mb
	- Seven bats = \[sɛvəmbæts]

Does not happen to \[m]



#### Intrusive "r"

In non-rhotic dialects of English, an \[ɹ] is inserted between two words if the first ends with a low vowel and the second starts with a vowelː
- \[ɑ] + \[ɪ] 
	- "The spa is broken"
	- \[ðəspɑɹɪzbɹoʊkn̩]



## Stress

Stress is the expression of linguistic prominence.

It is also a unit of rhythm in speech.

Many languages have stress, but there are some languages where it is not very prominent or even entirely absent.

Can be contrastive in languages: CONvert vs conVERT.



Stress is a property of the whole syllable, not just the vowel or syllabic sonorant
