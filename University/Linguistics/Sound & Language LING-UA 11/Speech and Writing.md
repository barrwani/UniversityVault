## English

- English is written with an alphabet that was designed for another language. 
- The language has around 40 distinct sounds (depending on dialect), but only 26 characters to write them 
	- The orthography resorts to combinations of letters (digraphs, trigraphs) to represent certain sounds, for example 'ng' stands for a single consonant similar to the 'm' and 'n' consonants

Most languages in Europe use either the Latin or Cyrillic alphabets. The Romans brought literacy to the British Isles, so the Latin alphabet stuck.

Orthographies tend to spread for reasons other than language, namely politics, economics, and religion.

It is often the case that a language will adopt an orthography that is not particularly well suited to its linguistic needs.

Certain societies tend to be conservative when it comes to changing orthographies, even in the face of dramatic language changes.



## How writing gets invented

The path is as follows:

- It begins by drawing pictures of thoughts you want to display
  
- This leads to pictographs
	- Pictographs are symbols that corresponds to ideas (Ex: Egyptian Hieroglyphs)
	- Because they represent meaning, they are very ambiguous 
	- "readers" wont know which words were meant, let alone how to string them into a sentence
	- Pictographs aside, all true writing systems represent sound
	  
- Then Logographic writing
	- Either represents meaning alone, or meaning and sound simultaneously 
	- REBUS Principle - word that sounds like X but means Y 
	- Chinese Characters, Mayan hieroglyphs
	  
- And either Syllabaries
	- Only represent sound, not meaning
	- Each character represents a syllable 
	- Evolved from logographic writing
	- Cherokee, Japanese
	- Quite limited, works best when possible syllables are small
		- Language constraints have to be strict for a syllabary to work 
		- Languages like Russian, which can have several adjacent consonants, would require hundreds of symbols
		  
- Or Alphabets
	- An ideal alphabet is where a single character represents a single sound, consonant or vowel
	- The only alphabet ever invented was the Phoenician alphabet from which all current alphabets descended/imitate
	- Abjads
		- The Phoenician alphabet is an abjad, meaning that only consonants are written
		- Other Abjads include Arabic and Hebrew
	- Completely divorced from meaning
	- Independent of the languages phonotactics; any language can be written with any alphabet regardless of how complex its syllables are
	- The IPA is designed with enough syllables for every language, it is, as its name suggests, an alphabet



English is an old orthography, so many of its spellings are outdated and do not reflect current pronounciation: 
- "knight" once pronounced the 'k' and 'gh'  
- The silent 'e' in words like 'bone'  used to be pronounced
- The "th" in "thigh" and "thy" used to be the same sound
- The "wh" in words like "which" would sound different than in "witch"

English is also a deep orthography, meaning that words that are related are spelled similarly despite being pronounced differently:
- electri**c** - electri**c**ity 
- **ato**m - **ato**mic
