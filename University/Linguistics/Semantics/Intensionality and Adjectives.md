# Intensionality and Adjectives
#linguistics 


## Adjectives

Adjectives motivating tracking objects over time and possibility.

- Some adjectives are purely intersective and can be adequately analyzed as defining a set of objects
	- EG: Red, lead, dead
- Subsective adjectives are sensitive to the NPs they modify. Gradable subsective adjectives like "tall" arrange objects in their NP set according to some scale (such as height)
	- "tall professor" is the subset of the set of professors that are at the top end of the height scale.
- Some adjectives require knowing not only what set the NP denote at the moment of the utterance, but also what set the NP denoted in the past
	- EG: Who counts as a former senator depends on who was in the set of senators in the past.
	- Some adjectives must take a matrix of sets of objects as their argument.


## Intentionality, Modality

Attitude verbs motivating tracking truth over time and possibility

Assume "its raining" and "uranium is toxic" are both true:
- "Ann thinks its raining" can be true at the same time "Ann thinks uranium is toxic" is false. 
	- Assuming compositionality, that means that "think" requires more information than just a truth value
	- It requires a matrix of truth and falsehood across time and possibility


Belief:
T: Amy believes {2=2} \[T T T T T T T...\] (tautology)
F Amy believes {today is Monday} \[T F F F F F F T F F F F F F T...\]

Beliefs don't always reflect the objective truth values of the statement. Amy can believe it is Monday and it not actually be Monday, but the statement Amy Believes it is Monday will hold true.


Conditions on promises:
- present tense
- active voice (?)
- Must be first person
	- Except for groups
- Are true by virtue of being uttered



Epistemic "might" depends on what is happening in non-actual worlds. 

For instance, "It might me raining" is true just in case there is a relevant possible world in which the prejacent ("it is raining") is true.



Conditionals can also depend on non-actual worlds. 

For instance:
- Take sentence "If CB is standing on a chair, he can reach the top of the board" 
- This is true just in case the most relevant possible world in which the antecedent (CB is standing on a chair) is true is also a world in which the consequent is true.
