# Ambiguity
#linguistics 

Semantics: the meaning of natural language.

Natural Language: complex, two-way communication used in daily life by humans
### Types of Ambiguity

- Lexical ambiguity
	- Single word
- Pronominal Ambiguity
	- What pronouns refer to
- Syntactic Ambiguity
	- Structural Difference

### Communication

Hypothesis: the reason people talk to each other is in order to exchange information


"I walked the dog yesterday" vs "I walked the damn dog yesterday"

Conveys same information, 'damn' doesn't change original information
- adds emotional investment information
- 'damn' : Expressive


Difference in what's been said, what's implied, and what's meant:

- Q: "Does Amy have a new love interest?"
- A: "She's been travelling a lot to Boston.."
	- Says (entailment):
		- She's been travelling 
		- She's been outside of Boston
	- Implied (Implicature):
		- Yes
		- No
	- Meant (Also implicature)

Entailments are guaranteed to be true. Implicatures are not guaranteed.
