Hypothesis: Pronouns refer to some individual indicated with a subscript. Which individual depends on :
- Speaker's intentions
- Who speaker is pointing at
- Reflexives depending on syntactic rules

Disha$_d$ is cool
She$_d$ left
She$_d$ likes herself$_d$
Amy $_a$ likes herself $_a$


Everyone likes her$_d$ mother

\[Every girl]$_x$ likes her$_x$ mother
Every girl$_x$ left
She$_y$ saw \[every girl]$_x$

\* She$_x$ saw \[every girl]$_x$ (ungrammatical)
