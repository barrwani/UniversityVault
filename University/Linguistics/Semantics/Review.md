1. Lexical Ambiguity:
	1. Bank. I'm withdrawing from a bank. I'm sat by the river bank.
	2. Cast. The cast of a show. To cast something in bronze.
	3. Bat. A flying animal. Baseball equipment.
2. "Ann left or Bill cried and Carl laughed"
	1. Either Ann left or Bill cried, and Carl laughed.
	2. Either Ann left, or Bill cried and Carl laughed.
3. Utterances
	1. No, sentences do not necessarily have to hold a truth value. Questions, for example, do not hold a truth value as their goal is to seek information. The answer to said questions typically holds a truth value, but the question itself does not.
4. Entailment
	1. Chug entails drink. We know this because Chugging is a more intense form of drinking, so for one to be chugging they must be drinking. We know drink does not entail chug because you can drink without chugging.
5. Presuppositions
	1. I have an uncle
	2. My uncle has a daughter
	3. My uncle's daughter has cigarettes
	4. My uncle smoked his daughters cigarettes
6. Tautologies and contradictions
	1. Tautologies
		1. 1=1
		2. It will rain tomorrow or it wont
		3. All bachelors are unmarried
	2. Contradictions
		1. It will rain tomorrow and it wont
		2. 1=2
		3. All bachelors are married
	3. What entails what?
		1. ??
7. Timelines
	1. Ann will have been swimming
	2. ----------U-----------
	3. ----------U-----E----- Event happens in future
	4. ----------U--E--R----- Referencing a time in the future when the event would have occurred in the past (relative to the reference)
	5. --------U--=E== -R----- Referencing a time in the future when the event would be happening, starting in the past  (relative to the reference)
	6. --------U--=E== -R----- 
			    ~~
			    Referencing a time in the future when the event would be happening, starting in the past  (relative to the reference). Durative marker just indicates it is an event that can happen indefinitely, so this event could go on past the reference.
8. Implicatures
	1. The cooperative principle is the assumption that based on context, a given sentence within a context implicates something that is relevant, sufficiently informative, truthful to the best of ones knowledge, and unambiguous. 
	2. Example: 
		1. Q: Is Ann going to be home for Christmas?
		2. A: She doesn't have that day off.
	3. The answer depends on assuming the cooperative principle, and it implies that Ann will not be home for Christmas. 
9. Trivial Entailment
	1. N/A
10. Trivial Presupposition
	1. Language Exists
11. Inference Rules
	1.  $\frac{A}{A\text{ or }B}$ $\frac{B}{A\text{ or }B}$
	2. $\frac{A\text{ and }B}{B}$ $\frac{A\text{ and }B}{A}$
12. Explanatory Theory
	1. $[[A\text{ and }B]] = [[A]] \cap [[B]]$ A and B is only true when both A and B are true, which is the intersection of A and B
	2. $[[A\text{ or }B]] = [[A]] \cup [[B]]$ A or B is true when either A or B or both are true, which is the union of A and B. 
	3. This is why A entails A or B while A and B entails A
13. Downward Entailing
	1. A context is downwards entailing if the superset entails the subset.  
	2. Example: Amy doubts that Bill ate Fish -> Amy doubts that Bill ate Cod
	3. Example: Amy ate Cod -> Amy ate Fish
	4. NPI's occur in downward entailing contexts
	5. Amy **doubts** that Bill ate Fish -> Amy **doubts** that Bill ate Cod
	6. Amy **rarely** eats meat -> Amy **rarely** eats beef
	7. George **didn't** say anything -> George **didn't** say hello
14. Most
	1. Licensing rule states that NPI's occur in non-upwards entailing contexts. A question such as "Did you only visit that place?" is not a DE context but still contains an NPI (only)
15. Conditionals and DE
	1. If Bob ran, his shoe fell off
	2. Antecedent: Yes
		1. If Bob ran, his shoe fell off -/> if bob moved, his shoe fell off
	3. If his shoe fell off, Bob ran
	4. Consequent: No
		1. If his shoe fell off, Bob ran -> if his shoe fell off, Bob moved
16. NPI Meaning
	1. It means that computers used to be expensive, but are no longer expensive. 
	2. If it were grammatical, it would mean that computers are fast, and used to not be fast.
	3. In years
		1. "Computers haven't been fast in years": Computers have been slow for a long time
		2. \*"Computers have been fast in years": Computers have been fast for a long time
	4. Yet
		1. "Computers aren't fast yet": Computers are not fast but are expected to be eventually
		2. \*"Computers are fast yet": Computers are fast but not expected to be at some point
17. Determiner meanings, conservativity
	1. Yes it is conservative
	2. if the rule for that determiner depends only on the cardinality of the NP, or else the cardinality of some other set intersected with NP it is conservative.
	3. Only would be non-conservative, because its truth value is dictated by everything not within the NP set being false. 
	4. half of not: half of those who are not NP.
18. Existential 'there'
	1. If it is conservative on its second argument. 
	2. six, some
	3. only
	4. just
19. Focus
	1. Presupposes that john eat vegetables
	2. Entails that john eats nothing but vegetables
	3. Presupposes that john does something else with vegetables
	4. Entails that john eats vegetables
	5. The **Principle of Question-Answer Congruence** is a linguistic principle that ensures that the form and content of an answer match the structure and focus of the question being asked.
20. Quantifier Raising
	1. Resolve Scope ambiguity
	2. Ensure phrase binding
