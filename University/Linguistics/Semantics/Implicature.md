>[!NOTE] The Cooperative Principle:
>"Make your contribution as such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged."


#### The Maxims of Cooperation

1. Quantity
	1. Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the exchange)
	2. Do not make your contribution more informative than is required
2. Quality
	1. Try to make your contribution one that is true
	2. Do not say what you believe to be false
	3. Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence
3. Relation
	1. Be relevant
4. Manner
	1. Be perspicuous
	2. Avoid obscurity of expression
	3. Avoid Ambiguity
	4. Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity)
	5. Be orderly

##### Example

Inspector: "Did you see anything odd in the office yesterday afternoon?"

Witness: "I left at 1PM yesterday."

1. Answer isn't **literally** relevant
	1. It looks like witness is flouting (disregarding) the maxim of relation
2. Assume witness is being cooperative
	1. How could the answer be relevant? 
3. Plausible
	1. It's hard to see things in the afternoon if you left at 1pm
4. Witness hasn't done anything to present the inference
5. Therefore the implicature is intended.


An implicature is an inference that arises from what is said by assuming that the participants are making their best effort to be cooperative. 

A single utterance can give rise to different implicatures depending on what you assume about what the intentions and the state of knowledge of the discourse participants.

Implicatures can be cancelled: A might implicate B but B can be cancelled by asserting A along with a denial of B. If B is an implicature this will not result in a contradiction.
