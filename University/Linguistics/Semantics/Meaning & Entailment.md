What is meaning? And what has meaning?
#### What has meaning?

	- morphemes
- Most words
- Some sequences of Words

What do we need to know in order to decide whether a sentence is true or not?

HYP: The meaning of a complex expression is **compositional**. The meaning of the whole depends in a systematic way on the meanings of the parts.

There are 3 kinds of meaning:

- [[Implicature]]
- Entailment
- [[Presupposition]]

## Entailment

- A disambiguated sentence $A$ entails a disambiguated sentence $B$ if and only if whenever $A$ is true $B$ must also be true.
- That is, the truth of $A$ guarantees the truth of $B$ no matter what
- If $A$ entails $B$ , the inference that $B$ is true cannot be cancelled. So if you assert $A$ along with the negation of $B$ the result must be a contradiction.
