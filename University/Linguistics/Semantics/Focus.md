# Focus
#linguistics 


- Focus in an answer lines up with the wh-phrase in the question. This is called **question/answer congruence**:
	- Q: Who left?     A: JOHN left (good)
	- Q: Who left?     A: John LEFT (bad)


## Only
Some words like only associate focus in a way that affects truth conditions.

Only:
- Entails that its prejacent is true
- Entails that nothing else besides the focus is relevant that makes the prejacent true when we use it to replace the focused expression


4. Amy only drinks Perrier
5. Amy doesn't drink anything that is not Perrier
6. Any drinks Perrier
Prejacent: "Amy drinks Perrier"

**Only** presupposes the prejacent

Bold is focused expression (stress)

Amy only drinks **Perrier**
- $\implies \neg$ (Amy drinks Evian) 
- $\implies \neg$ (Amy drinks Fiji)

## Also

Normally the VP only associates with the focus inside the VP

- Amy also drinks **Perrier**
- Amy drinks Perrier
- Amy drinks something besides Perrier

- Amy also **drinks** Perrier
- **Amy** also drinks Perrier

**Also** presupposes ...

Both also and only are focus sensitive.


- 1 Amy **left** too
- 2 **Amy** left too
- 3 Amy left ($2 \implies 3$)
- 4 Someone other than Amy left ($2 \implies 4$)

Some relevant alternative to the focus expression makes the prejacent true when substituted in place of the focus


## 

What do different syntactic objects denote?

Proper names: Object

NP: set of objects
VP: set of objects
Q: set of possible answers
Det: A function from two sets of objects to a truth value

Q/A: The expression in focus in an answer is the same syntactic role as the WH word in the question.

Algorithm for computing the truth conditions of a sentence of the form "DP only VP", where some constituent inside the VP is in focus:
- "DP only VP" presupposes "DP VP"
- Find a set of contextually relevant alternatives to the element in focus.
	- Substitute the alternatives in place of the focused element
	- Each substituted sentence will be entailed to be false

Example:
1. Ann only ate a GREEN apple
2. Presupposes Ann ate a green apple
3. Entails that "Ann ate a red apple" and  "Ann ate a yellow apple" are false.
