# Focus


Only: 
- Entails that its prejacent is true
- Entails that nothing else besides the focus is relevant that makes the prejacent true when we use it to replace the focused expression


4. Amy only drinks perrier
5. Amy doesn't drink anything that is not perrier
6. Any drinks perrier
Prejacent: "Amy drinks perrier"

**Only** presupposes the prejacent

Bold is focused expression (stress)

Amy only drinks **perrier**
- $\implies \neg$ (Amy drinks Evian) 
- $\implies \neg$ (Amy drinks Fiji)

Normally the VP only associates with the focus inside the VP

- Amy also drinks **perrier**
- Amy drinks perrier
- Amy drinks something besides perrier

- Amy also **drinks** perrier
- **Amy** also drinks perrier

**Also** presupposes ...

Both also and only are focus sensitive.


- 1 Amy **left** too
- 2 **Amy** left too
- 3 Amy left ($2 \implies 3$)
- 4 Someone other than Amy left ($2 \implies 4$)

Some relevant alternative to the focus expression makes the prejacent true when substituted in place of the focus

Proper names: Object

NP: set of objects
VP: set of objects
Q: set of possible answers
Det: A function from two sets of objects to a truth value

Q/A: The expression in focus in an answer is the same syntactic role as the WH word in the question.
