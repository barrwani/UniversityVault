# Verbs of Judging

## Types of Lexical Information

## 1. Approaching the Meaning of a Word
### Mentalist Approaches
- The meaning of a word is associated with the image or concept in the head of the speaker before utterance, and/or the hearer after utterance.
- **Potential issues**: Challenges in creating a general theory of communication.

### Behaviourist Approaches
- The meaning of an utterance is fully associated with the input and output situations and associated actions of participants (Bloomfield).
- **Potential problems**: Over-reliance on observable behavior, neglecting internal cognitive processes.

### Structuralist Approaches
- The meaning of a word is what’s in common with all situations in which it is appropriately used.
- **Potential problems**: Difficulty in defining what is "common" across all situations.

### Decompositional Approaches
- Break down the meaning of words into features or components.
- Use ideas from behaviourist and structuralist approaches.
- Example: For nouns, use selectional restrictions of verbs to test for particular features/properties.
  - (1a) The wolf fell. → wolf has feature \[+PHYSICAL OBJECT]
  - (1b) The wolf dreamed. → wolf has feature \[+ANIMATE]
  - (1c) \#The wolf wrote a speech. → wolf has feature \[—HUMAN]

### Fillmore’s Lexical Entries for _accuse_ and _criticize_

Fillmore’s lexical entries for _accuse_ and _criticize_ are structured to capture the semantic roles and presuppositions associated with these verbs. Here’s a detailed explanation of each component:

---

#### **ACCUSE \[Judge, Defendant, Situation]**

- **Primary Meaning**: SAY \[Judge, ‘X’, Addressee]
    
    - This indicates that _accuse_ is a verb of saying, where the **Judge** (the person making the accusation) communicates something (‘X’) to an **Addressee** (the person being addressed).
        
    - The content of the accusation (‘X’) is that the **Defendant** (the person being accused) is **RESPONSIBLE** for the **Situation** (the event or action being judged).
        
- **Presupposition**: BAD \[Situation]
    
    - This means that when someone uses _accuse_, it is presupposed that the **Situation** is **BAD** (i.e., blameworthy or negative).
        
    - For example, in the sentence _Jaakko accused Henrik of writing the letter_, it is presupposed that writing the letter was a bad thing.
        

**Key Points**:

- _Accuse_ is a communicative act where the Judge explicitly assigns responsibility to the Defendant for a bad situation.
    
- The badness of the situation is a presupposition, meaning it is taken for granted and not directly asserted.

#### **CRITICIZE [Judge, Defendant, Situation]**

- **Primary Meaning**: SAY [Judge, ‘X’, Addressee]
    
    - Like _accuse_, _criticize_ is also a verb of saying, where the **Judge** communicates something (‘X’) to an **Addressee**.
        
    - The content of the criticism (‘X’) is that the **Situation** is **BAD**.
        
- **Presupposition**: RESPONSIBLE [Situation, Defendant]

    - For example, in the sentence _Jaakko criticized Henrik for writing the letter_, it is presupposed that Henrik was responsible for writing the letter.
        
- **Presupposition**: ACTUAL [Situation]

    - For example, in the sentence _Jaakko criticized Henrik for writing the letter_, it is presupposed that the letter was actually written.
        

**Key Points**:

- _Criticize_ is a communicative act where the Judge evaluates the Situation as bad and presupposes that the Defendant is responsible for it.
    
- The actuality of the Situation is also presupposed, meaning the event being criticized must have actually occurred.
