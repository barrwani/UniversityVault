# Polysemy & Sense Relations
#linguistics 

## Sense Relations  

### Semantic vs. Lexical Relations  
- **Semantic relations:** Between meanings of words.  
- **Lexical relations:** Between words in the lexicon, including meanings and other aspects.  

### Hypernymy and Hyponymy  
- **Hypernym:** A general category that includes more specific types (e.g., *ingest* → eat, drink, smoke).  
- **Hyponym:** A more specific term within a category (e.g., *walk* → locomote, move).  
- **Properties:**  
  - Asymmetry: If *A* is a hypernym of *B*, *B* is not a hypernym of *A*.  
  - Restricted to same word class (e.g., noun-noun, verb-verb).  
  - Operates at the level of **word sense** (e.g., *bank* as a financial institution vs. riverbank).  

### Synonymy  
- **Synonyms:** Words with the same meaning.  
- **True synonymy requires full substitutability** (rare in natural language).  
- **Properties:**  
  - Symmetric: If *A* is a synonym of *B*, then *B* is a synonym of *A*.  
  - Applies within the same word class.  

### Antonymy/Opposition  
- **Contrary antonyms:** Can both be false but not true at the same time (*tall* vs. *short*).  
- **Complementary antonyms:** If one is true, the other must be false (*even* vs. *odd*).  
- **Converse antonyms:** Opposing perspectives (*parent* vs. *child*).  
- **Reversive antonyms:** Reverse an action (*tie* vs. *untie*).  

### Additional Sense Relations  
- **Meronym:** A term that refers to a part of a whole (*finger* → *hand*).  
- **Holonym:** The whole to which a meronym belongs (*hand* → *finger*).  
- **Superordinate:** A hypernym that categorizes subtypes (*dog* → *dachshund*).  
- **Co-hyponyms:** Words that share a superordinate (*poodle* & *terrier* under *dog*).  


## Ambiguity and Lexical Senses  
- **Ambiguity:** A word has multiple interpretations.  
- **Types:**  
  - **Structural ambiguity:** Due to syntax (*I shot an elephant in my pajamas*).  
  - **Lexical ambiguity:** A word has different meanings (*bank* as a financial institution vs. a riverbank).  


## Polysemy  

### Nouns with Multiple Facets  
- **Facets:** Discrete but related meanings within a single sense.  
- **Example:** *Book* has two facets:  
  - *Tome* (physical object)  
  - *Text* (content)  

### Diagnostics for Identifying Facets  
- **Distinct semantic relations:** Each facet has separate hyponyms and meronyms.  
- **Independent truth conditions:** A word can be true for one facet but false for another.  
- **Autonomous reference:** A facet can be referred to independently.  
- **Selective predicates:** Some verbs/adjectives apply to one facet but not the other.  
- **Independent metaphorical extension:** Some metaphors apply to one facet only.  

### Evidence for a Unified Meaning  
- **Joint reference:** A single sentence can refer to multiple facets (*The book on the table is fascinating*).  
- **Predicates requiring multiple facets:** Some words require both facets (*borrow, publish, read*).  
- **Shared superordinates and co-hyponyms:** E.g., *publication* as a hypernym of *book*.  
- **Joint metaphorical extension:** Some metaphors reference all facets (*Her mind is a closed book*).  

### Polysemy vs. Homonymy  
- **Polysemy:** A word has multiple related meanings (*coat* as a garment, animal fur, or paint layer).  
- **Homonymy:** A word has completely unrelated meanings (*bat* as an animal vs. a baseball bat).  
- **Zeugma test:** If combining meanings sounds odd, it indicates homonymy (*She used the pen for writing and to contain animals*).  

### Other Multiply-Faceted Nouns  
- **Media:** *brochure, record, DVD* → physical object vs. content.  
- **Institutions:** *bank, hospital, museum* → place, personnel, organization.  



## Systematic Polysemy  
- **Regular patterns of meaning extension in the lexicon.**  
- **Examples:**  
  - *Animal/Food:* *chicken* (bird vs. meat).  
  - *Tree/Wood:* *oak* (tree vs. material).  
  - *Container/Contents:* *bottle* (glass object vs. liquid inside).  
  - *Physical Object/Aperture:* *window* (glass vs. opening).  
  - *Physical Object/Institution:* *bank* (building vs. financial organization).  
  - *Event/Result Object:* *solution* (process vs. outcome).  

### Systematic Polysemy vs. Metonymy  
- **Metonymy:** Using an associated term to refer to something (*The ham sandwich is waiting for their check* = customer).  
- **Polysemy:** Lexicalized multiple meanings, metonymy is contextual.  

### Two Types of Systematic Polysemy  
- **Balanced senses:** Neither is more basic (*book* as physical & informational object).  
- **Hierarchical senses:** One meaning is derived from another (*oak* as tree vs. material).
