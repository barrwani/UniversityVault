# Grammatical regularities: denominal verbs

## Conceptual and grammatical knowledge

Plato’s problem: we know more about word meanings than we could learn from exposure alone.

- Example: The verb *paint* means “to cover with paint” and can be extended to rollers, spray cans, etc.
- Some extensions are not possible:
  - *The explosion painted the workers red.* (Cannot describe a vat of paint exploding.)
  - *Velázquez painted his brush.* (Cannot describe dipping a brush in paint.)
- Speakers generalize word meanings systematically, guided by general principles.
- Denominal verbs demonstrate interactions between conceptual knowledge, semantic constraints, and syntax.

## Overview of denominal verbs

English derives verbs from nouns without morphological changes.

- Zero-derivation is productive and can be used innovatively.
- Examples:
  - *Hoover* (vacuum)
  - *Xerox* (photocopy)
  - *Houdini* (escape artist behavior)
  - *Boycott* (named after Charles Boycott)
- Children spontaneously create denominal verbs:
  - *Mummy trousers me.* (Getting dressed)
  - *I broomed her.* (Hitting with a toy broom)
  - *You have to scale it first.* (Wanting cheese weighed)

Denominal verbs follow systematic interpretation patterns.

- A denominal verb paraphrases using its base noun.
- These paraphrases help classify denominal verbs.

### Categories of denominal verbs

- **Locatum verbs**: *To put N on OBJ*  
  - *Plaster a wall* → *Put plaster on a wall*
  - Examples: blanket, saddle, wallpaper, grease

- **Location verbs**: *To put OBJ in/on N*  
  - *Cage a hamster* → *Put the hamster in a cage*
  - Examples: bag, bottle, pasture, box

- **Removal verbs**: *To remove N from OBJ*  
  - *Shell a walnut* → *Remove the shell from a walnut*
  - Examples: core, gut, husk, weed

- **Extraction verbs**: *To remove OBJ from N*  
  - *Mine gold* → *Remove gold from the mine*
  - Examples: quarry

- **Instrument verbs**: *To use N for its purpose*  
  - *Rake the leaves* → *Use a rake on the leaves*
  - Examples: brush, hammer, mop, shovel

- **Agent verbs**: *To act in occupation/role N*  
  - *To volunteer* → *Act as a volunteer*
  - Examples: butcher, captain, tutor

- **Duration verbs**: *To perform activities associated with N*  
  - *To vacation* → *Perform vacation activities*
  - Examples: breakfast, brunch, summer

## Case study: locatum vs. location verbs

- **Locatum verbs**: The verb’s base noun is placed in or on an object (*blanket the bed*).
- **Location verbs**: The object is placed in or on the base noun (*shelve the books*).

Cross-linguistic consistency exists in denominal verb patterns.

- German examples:
  - *satteln* (‘to saddle’ from *Sattel*)
  - *gärtnern* (‘to garden’ from *Gärtner*)
  - *bedachen* (‘to roof’ from *Dach*)

## Decompositional analyses for denominal verbs

Locatum and location verbs involve two noun roles.

- One noun forms the verb.
- The other noun appears as the direct object.
- Reversing roles alters meaning:
  - *Paper the shelves* (cover shelves with paper)
  - *Shelve the papers* (place papers on a shelf)

Proposed semantic relations:

- **Pure location (BE-ON, BE-IN, BE-AT)**  
  - *Shelve a book* → *CAUSE (BE-ON(book, shelf))*
- **Possession (HAVE, HAVE-ON, HAVE-IN)**  
  - *Shoe a horse* → *CAUSE (HAVE-ON (horse, shoe))*

Finnish case marking provides evidence for this distinction.

## Flexibility in meaning

Denominal verbs vary in strictness.

- Rigid cases:
  - *Box a present* (not *in a paper bag*)
  - *Bag groceries* (not *in a box*)
- Flexible cases:
  - *Shelve a book* (even on a windowsill)
  - *Paint a throat with iodine*
  - *Butter toast with margarine*

## True or apparent denominal verbs?

Some verbs resemble denominal forms but function differently.

- **True denominal verbs**: Require the actual noun.
  - *Tape a picture* (not *with tacks*)
  - *Bicycle down the road* (not *on a unicycle*)
- **Manner-denoting verbs**: Describe an action style rather than an object.
  - *Hammer the desk with a shoe*
  - *Brush a coat with a hand*

Denominal verbs tend to maintain the noun’s stress pattern.

- *To pattern, to index* (vs. *discern, assert*)
- Regular inflection: *ink → inked*, *ring → ringed* (not *rang*)

## Conclusion

Denominal verbs derive meaning from world knowledge about objects and their functions.

- Their structure is constrained by canonical uses.
- Some allow meaning flexibility (e.g., *paint* extends to iodine).
- Others behave as manner verbs rather than true denominal verbs.

Understanding denominal verb formation provides insight into lexical semantics, argument structure, and morphological productivity.
