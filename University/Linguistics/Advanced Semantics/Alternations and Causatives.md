# Alternations and Causatives in Lexical Semantics
#linguistics 
## Semantic Roles and Argument Structure

Verbs like *break* and *hit* illustrate how semantic roles (e.g., Agent, Instrument, Patient, Theme) are encoded in lexical semantics. These roles explain syntactic patterns and argument realizations:

- **Break**:  
  - Intransitive: "The window broke." (Patient)  
  - Transitive: "Jussi broke the window." (Agent, Patient)  
  - Instrumental: "The rock broke the window." (Instrument, Patient)  

- **Hit**:  
  - Transitive: "Jussi hit the tree." (Agent, Theme)  
  - Instrumental: "A rock hit the tree." (Instrument, Theme)  

Key observations:  
- The Patient in *break* undergoes a change of state, while the Theme in *hit* is a location of impact.  
- Semantic roles predict syntactic behavior, e.g., possessed body parts:  
  - *I broke his leg.* (Patient) vs. *I hit him on the leg.* (Theme).  

## The Causative Alternation

Change-of-state verbs like *break*, *open*, and *cool* exhibit the causative alternation:  
- **Inchoative (intransitive)**: "The window broke." (describes a change of state)  
- **Causative (transitive)**: "Jussi broke the window." (adds an external causer)  

### Externally vs. Internally Caused Events  
- **Externally caused events**: Require an external force (e.g., *break*, *open*). These verbs allow the causative alternation.  
- **Internally caused events**: Originate within the subject (e.g., *bloom*, *cough*). These verbs do not alternate.  

### Non-Alternating Verbs  
- **Intransitives without causatives**:  
  - *The children played.* but *\*The teacher played the children.*  
  - Internally caused actions resist adding an external causer.  
- **Transitives without inchoatives**:  
  - *Lara cut the cake.* but *\*The cake cut.*  
  - Verbs like *cut* and *hit* describe actions where the patient's properties are irrelevant to the event.  

## Lexical Decomposition

Causative verbs can be decomposed into semantic primitives:  
- *Jussi broke the window.* → CAUSE (Jussi, BECOME (window, BROKEN))  
- *Sheppard killed Ackroyd.* → CAUSE (Sheppard, BECOME (Ackroyd, DEAD))  

Evidence for decomposition:  
- **Temporal modifiers**: "The city closed the road for two months." implies the road was closed for two months.  
- **Restitutive *again***: "The city opened the road again." can mean the road returned to a prior state.  
- **Scope of *almost***: "Jussi almost killed Bill." can mean Jussi almost acted or the action almost succeeded.  

## Analytic Causatives

When lexical causatives are unavailable, English uses periphrastic causatives like *make*, *cause*, *have*, and *let*:  
- *Gurung made the children dance.* (indirect causation)  
- *The magician caused the audience to gasp.* (neutral causation)  

### Key Differences:  
- **Make**: Implies intention and coercion.  
- **Cause**: Neutral about intention, focuses on result.  
- **Have**: Suggests authority or instruction.  
- **Let**: Permissive, allowing an action to occur.  

### Cross-Linguistic Patterns  
- **German *lassen***: Covers meanings from *make* to *let*.  
- **Hindi morphological causatives**:  
  - *Darvaazaa khul-aa.* (The door opened.)  
  - *Us-ne darvaazaa khol-aa.* (She opened the door.)  
  - Derived causatives (e.g., *jal-aa* = burn.CAUS) may introduce direct or indirect causers.  

## Summary  
- Semantic roles and argument structure explain verb behavior.  
- The causative alternation depends on whether events are externally or internally caused.  
- Lexical decomposition reveals underlying semantic primitives like CAUSE and BECOME.  
- Analytic causatives express nuanced causal relationships beyond lexical causatives.
