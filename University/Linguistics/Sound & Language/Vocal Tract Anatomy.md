## Larynx

The key requirement for producing human speech is to have a lowered larynx. 

The larynx is a structure of cartilage and muscle with several functions. For humans, the larynx is essential for closing the air passages when eating/drinking

Many animals use the larynx to vocalise too. The Human larynx is lower than in most mammal species, which increases the danger of choking because food and breathing passages cross as the epiglottis and soft palate do not form a seal to prevent food from entering the windpipe.

It does, however, come with key advantages. 

In human babies, the larynx starts out high and gradually lowers 
	- Human speech sounds are impossible before this.


The length of distance between the larynx and the lips (the area which constitutes the entire vocal tract), correlates with pitch and perceived body size. Humans likely have a lowered larynx to make their voices sound relatively deeper than their size in an effort to ward off predators.
