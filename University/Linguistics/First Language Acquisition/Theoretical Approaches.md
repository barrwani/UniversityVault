# Theoretical Approaches to Language Development
#linguistics 

## Usage-Based Approaches 
- **Emphasis**: Empiricism, Evolutionary plausibility  
- **Key Idea**: Form emerges from function (usage); competence/performance distinction is less important.  
  
- **Evolutionary Perspective**:  
  - Spoken language is a relatively late development in human evolution (e.g., Stokoe 2001).  
  - It may overlay and co-opt an older gestural-based communication system or a full-fledged sign language (Corballis 2010).  
    
- **Key Researcher**: Michael Tomasello (Evolutionary Anthropologist).  
  
- **Characteristics**:  
  - Language development relies on general cognitive abilities alone.  
  - Abstraction emerges through exposure and interaction.  
  - Stresses the importance of speaker intentions in learning.  
  - Challenges arbitrariness and language-specific genetic abilities.  
    
- **Language Rules**: Fully **epigenetic**—rules emerge from input and reflect usage patterns.  
  
- **Supporting Evidence**:  
  - Evolutionarily plausible; no need for recent genetic mutations specific to language.  
  - Domain-general cognitive abilities are more powerful than previously believed.  
  - Poverty of the Stimulus may be unrealistic—children receive abundant input and focus on developing cognitive skills, including language.  
    
- **Contrary Evidence/Criticism**:  
  - Misalignment between child language and input (e.g., errors like "I eated a cookie" not found in input).  
  - Frequency in input does not fully predict acquisition order (e.g., Ninio 2011).  
  - Child comprehension patterns sometimes diverge from input, suggesting possible language-specific constraints.  
  - Homesign develops without input (though interaction is present).  
  - High-functioning/low-support autistic individuals may develop language despite lacking joint attention or understanding social intentions, countering the primacy of **social-intentions** in acquisition.  

## Generative: Nativism Today 
- **Key Idea**: Generative linguists adhere to nativist theories, with variation in what is considered innate.  
  - **Nativist Definition**: Believing even one language-specific, innate property qualifies as nativism.  
  - **Minimalist Generative View**: Only the computational function **Merge** is innate; all else is learned from experience and domain-general capacities.  

## Generative: Merge Function 
- **Definition**: A structure-building operation in Minimalism (Chomsky & Lasnik, 1993).  
  - Takes two linguistic objects (e.g., morphemes, words, phrases) and forms a new object:  
    $(\alpha, \beta \rightarrow \{\alpha, \beta\} = \alpha_1 \rightarrow \{\alpha_1, \gamma\} = \alpha_2)$...  
  - Builds binary-branching, asymmetrically labeled trees.  
- **Recursion**: Merge is recursive, enabling structures like "The girl with the dog with the hat..."  

## Generative: Principles and Parameters 
- **Minimalism**: A sub-type of Principles and Parameters (P&P), aiming to capture cross-linguistic variation and learnability.  
- **Principles**: Innate and universal (e.g., "All phrases have a head").  
- **Parameters**: Determine cross-linguistic variability (e.g., Verb-Object vs. Object-Verb order).  
- **Features**: Language-specific (e.g., \[FUTURE] as a verbal inflectional feature in French but not English).  

## Generative Approaches (Chomskyan Tradition)
- **Key Debate**: Nativism (Generative) vs. Strict Empiricism (Usage-Based).  
  - **Central Question**: Is there content independent of and prior to experience?  
- **Dominant Approaches Today**:  
  - *Usage-Based* (strict-empiricist).  
  - *Generative* (nativist, often attributing abstract properties to UG).  
- **Importance**: These theories make **testable predictions**.  

## Valian (2009) 
- **Focus**: Initial State vs. Final State in language acquisition.  
  - Linguistic research prioritizes the *Final State* (properties of adult languages).  
  - Theories of the Final State inform theories of the Initial State and learning processes.  

## Case Study: Child Categories 
- **Problem**: Languages vary, and universal grammatical categories are debated.  
- **Final-State Assumptions**:  
  - *Strict-Empiricist (Usage-Based)*: No innate categories; universals arise from empirical patterns.  
  - *Nativist (Non-Minimalist)*: Innate categories guide learning.  
- **L1 Development Questions**:  
  - Do children start with basic categories? (Yes = Nativist; No = Strict Empiricist).  
  - Do children build basic categories? (Yes = Strict Empiricist; No = Nativist).  

## Determiners as a Category 
- **Definition**: Provide reference information about nouns (e.g., "the cat," "a cat").  
- **Distribution**: Varies by language (e.g., English vs. Spanish).  

## The Overlap Test (Pine & Martindale 1996) 
- **Method**: Measures if children use multiple determiners (e.g., "a" and "the") with the same noun.  
- **Findings**: Low overlap in child speech, suggesting limited-scope formulae (supporting strict-empiricism).  

## Valian et al. (2009) 
- **Criticism of Pine & Lieven (1997)**:  
  - Ignores caregiver input.  
  - Overlap increases with opportunity (e.g., nouns used more frequently with determiners).  
  - Children's overlap scores resemble mothers', supporting continuity (nativist view).  

## Yang (2004)
- **Key Argument**: Statistical learning requires innate linguistic assumptions (UG).  
  - Example: Syllable stress rules improve segmentation accuracy.  
- **Parameters**: Probabilistic (not binary), representing competing grammars.  

## Key Concepts
- **Theoretical Adequacy**: Descriptive, Model, Explanatory.  
- **Dichotomies**: Structuralism vs. Functionalism; Competence vs. Performance; Nativism vs. Empiricism.  
- **Approaches**:  
  - *Behaviorist*: Tabula rasa, conditioning, reinforcement.  
  - *Early Cognitive*: Poverty of the Stimulus, LAD, UG, learnability.  
  - *Usage-Based*: Epigenetic, domain-general learning.  
- **Case Studies**: Category overlap (nouns & determiners).  
- **Yang (2004)**: Statistics need UG; probabilistic grammars.
