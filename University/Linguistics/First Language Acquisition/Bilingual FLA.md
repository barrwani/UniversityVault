# Bilingual First Language Acquisition (BFLA)
#linguistics 

## Defining Bilingualism  
- **Definition**: Everyday use of two or more languages (Grosjean 2011).  
- **Competence vs. Usage**: Ranges from basic ability to near-native fluency in additional languages.  
- **Multilingualism**: Extension to three or more languages.  

## Key Questions in BFLA  
- **Age of Onset**: Impact on language mastery.  
- **Developmental Challenges**: Whether BFLA poses unique difficulties.  
- **Language Differentiation**: How and when bilinguals separate their languages.  
- **Comparison to Monolinguals**: Time course and developmental path similarities/differences.  

## Terminology  
- **Developmental Path**: Progression in linguistic domains (e.g., phonology, syntax).  
- **Time Course**: Milestone timing (e.g., first words, complex sentences).  
- **Dominance**: Language with greater input frequency, production use, or faster development.  
- **Age of Onset (AoO)**:  
  - *Simultaneous*: Exposure to both languages from birth.  
  - *Sequential*: Exposure to second language before age 3.  

## Historical Context  
- **Early Studies**:  
  - Ronjat (1913): "One parent-one language" method showed successful bilingual acquisition.  
  - Leopold (1949): Observed codemixing stages, suggesting temporary language confusion.  
- **Global Prevalence**: Majority of the world is bilingual (Grosjean 2011).  

## Theoretical Frameworks  
### Unitary Language Hypothesis (ULH)  
- **Stages**:  
  1. Single lexicon (mixed vocabulary).  
  2. Separate lexicons, unified grammar.  
  3. Fully differentiated languages.  
- **Debate**: Whether initial language systems are merged or distinct.  

### Autonomous vs. Interdependent Development  
- **Autonomous**: Languages develop independently from the outset.  
- **Interdependent**: Languages interact during development (e.g., cross-linguistic transfer).  

## Linguistic Domains in BFLA  
### Phonological Development  
- **Suprasegmental**: Infants distinguish prosodic features (e.g., Mandarin tones vs. French syllables).  
- **Segmental**: Delayed phoneme discrimination in word-learning but eventual language-specific tuning.  

### Lexical Development  
- **Vocabulary Milestones**: Similar to monolinguals when combining both languages.  
- **Translation Equivalents**: Violate mutual exclusivity (e.g., *dog* vs. *chien*); emerge gradually (~20-25% of vocabulary by 1;5).  

### Morphosyntax Development  
- **Early Differentiation**: Bilinguals separate grammatical systems early (e.g., French finite verbs vs. English optional infinitives).  
- **Cross-Linguistic Transfer**:  
  - *Döpke (2000)*: Overgeneralization of SVO word order in German-English bilinguals.  
  - *Yip & Matthews (2000)*: Cantonese accelerates English relative clause acquisition.  

## Communicative Competence  
- **Codemixing**:  
  - *Inter-utterance*: Switching between sentences ("Je veux un film. Can we watch Toy Story?").  
  - *Intra-utterance*: Switching within sentences ("Mommy, je veux milk").  
- **Grammatical Constraints**: Mixing occurs only at syntactically permissible points (e.g., concordant noun phrases: *le dog*).  
- **Social Functions**: Marks identity, manages lexical gaps, or adapts to interlocutors (e.g., dominant language functional morphemes).  

### Parental Discourse Strategies  
- **Encouraging Mixing**: "Move-on" (continue conversation) or "expressed guess" (rephrase for confirmation).  
- **Discouraging Mixing**: Insisting on one language per parent.  

## Heritage Languages  
- **Definition**: Family languages of immigrant-background children in majority-language environments.  
- **Challenges**: Incomplete acquisition or attrition due to reduced input.  

## Key Findings  
- **Input Frequency**: Bilinguals may show delays in frequency-dependent aspects (e.g., vocabulary size per language).  
- **Research Gaps**: Fewer studies on BFLA vs. monolingual acquisition due to methodological complexities (e.g., input variability).  

## Key Concepts  
- **Theories**: ULH, autonomous/interdependent development.  
- **Critical Studies**: Paradis & Genesee (1996), Döpke (2000), Yip & Matthews (2000).  
- **Codemixing**: Types, grammatical rules, and social functions.  
- **Heritage Languages**: Incomplete acquisition dynamics.  

---  
**Note**: BFLA research highlights both parallels to monolingual acquisition and unique bilingual phenomena (e.g., transfer, codemixing), emphasizing the role of input and social context in shaping dual language systems.
