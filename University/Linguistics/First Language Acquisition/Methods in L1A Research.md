## Naturalistic Studies
- **Diary or Parental Report**  
  - Offline measure where caregivers record or report a child’s vocabulary, grammatical milestones, or language usage. Often supplementary to experimental or corpus studies.  
- **Corpus-Based Studies**  
  - Children are recorded in naturalistic settings to collect data "from the wild."  
  - Utilizes resources like CHILDES corpora to analyze frequency and input effects.  
- **Advantages**  
  - Provides systematic study of child language in natural contexts, including frequency, usage, and contextual factors.  

## Experimental Studies
- **Behavioral and Neuroimaging**  
  - Tasks designed to collect specific data for hypothesis testing.  
  - Measures behaviors or neural activation to infer linguistic knowledge.  
- **Advantages**  
  - Captures constructions that may not appear in natural speech.  
  - Includes controls and baselines for clearer interpretation.  

## Computational Modeling
- **Purpose**  
  - Uses programming to simulate language learning based on explicit assumptions.  
  - Tests theories by comparing model outputs to child behavior.  
- **Example**  
  - Simulates statistical learning of syllable transitions for segmentation tasks.  

## Comprehension vs. Production Asymmetry
- **Comprehension Tasks**  
  - Measure receptive knowledge (e.g., sound contrasts, sentence interpretation).  
  - Methods: High-Amplitude Sucking, Head-Turn Preference, Preferential Looking.  
- **Production Tasks**  
  - Measure productive knowledge (e.g., sound production, sentence construction).  
  - Methods: Elicited Speech, Repetition Tasks, Nonce-Word Tasks.  

## Experiments by Linguistic Domain
### Phonological Development
- **Perception/Comprehension**  
  - High-Amplitude Sucking Paradigm: Measures infant response to sound contrasts.  
  - Head-Turn Preference Procedure: Tests discrimination of phonological patterns.  
  - Preferential Looking Paradigm: Assesses recognition of sound contrasts.  
- **Production**  
  - Elicited Speech: Analyzes child’s sound inventory and phonotactics.  
  - Nonce-Word Repetition: Tests metaphonological awareness.  

### Morphosyntactic Development
- **Production Tasks**  
  - Repetition/Imitation: Evaluates ability to reproduce or correct sentences.  
  - Nonce-Word Tasks (e.g., Wug Test): Tests generalization of morphological rules.  
  - Elicited Production: Prompts rare sentence types (e.g., recursion).  
  - Sentence-Completion/Repair: Measures metasyntactic development.  
- **Comprehension Tasks**  
  - Act-Out Tasks: Assesses interpretation through object manipulation.  
  - Preference Tasks: Evaluates grammaticality or meaning preferences.  

### Semantic and Pragmatic Development
- **Storytelling Tasks (e.g., Frog Stories)**  
  - Elicits narrative skills and coherence in storytelling.  
- **Truth-Value Judgement Tasks**  
  - Tests interpretation of logical operators (e.g., negation, possibility).  
  - Uses scenarios with puppets to judge sentence truth-conditions.  

## Key Concepts
- **Hypothesis Testing**  
  - Theory generates hypotheses, which experiments test, influencing theoretical refinement.  
- **Corpus Studies**  
  - Analyze naturalistic data for frequency and input effects.  
- **Experimental Methods**  
  - High-Amplitude Sucking, Head-Turn Preference, Preferential Looking.  
  - Repetition, Elicited Production, Preference, Sentence-Completion, Truth-Value Judgement, Storytelling Tasks.  
- **Computational Modeling**  
  - Simulates learning processes to test theoretical assumptions.
