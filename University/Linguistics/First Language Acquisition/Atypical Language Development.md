# Atypical Language Development  
#linguistics 

## Intellectual Disability (ID) and Language  
- **Definition**: Characterized by IQ <70, with severe language difficulties common when IQ <50.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - **Mental Age (MA)** predicts language abilities better than chronological age.  
  - Impaired **phonological working memory** (Schuchardt et al., 2011).  
  - Etiologies include **Down Syndrome (DS)**, **Williams Syndrome (WS)**, and **Fragile X Syndrome (FraX)**.  


## Williams Syndrome  
- **Genetic Profile**: Rare (1:20,000), caused by chromosome 7 deletion.  
- **Cognitive-Language Dissociation**:  
  - **Relative Strengths**: Sophisticated vocabulary for MA, strong narrative skills.  
  - **Deficits**: Abstract vocabulary (time, space), complex grammar (e.g., passives).  
- **Controversy**: Early claims of "intact language" overstated (Brock, 2007).  


## Down Syndrome (DS)  
- **Genetic Profile**: Trisomy 21 (1:691 births).  
- **Language Profile**:  
  - **Delayed but Not Deviant**: Slow progression (e.g., 5 years to reach 18-month MA).  
  - **Phonology**: Impaired due to poor working memory and **macroglossia** (large tongue).  
  - **Strengths**: Strong pragmatics, social humor, and narrative skills.  


## Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)  
- **Prevalence**: 1:36 children (CDC, 2024), with a male predominance.  
- **Language Challenges**:  
  - **Pragmatic Deficits**: Impaired joint attention, eye gaze, and symbolic play.  
  - **Echolalia**: Repetitive speech (75% prevalence) but poor nonce-word imitation.  
  - **Theory of Mind**: Difficulty with pronouns, mental state verbs, and abstract concepts.  
- **Interventions**:  
  - Naturalistic therapies (e.g., Pivotal Response Training) target communication to reduce frustration.  


## Developmental Language Disorder (DLD)  
- **Diagnosis**: Language impairment **without** ID, ASD, or hearing loss (7% prevalence).  
- **Core Features**:  
  - **Lexicon**: Anomia (slow word retrieval), circumlocution, impaired fast-mapping.  
  - **Morphosyntax**: Omissions of functional morphemes (e.g., plurals, auxiliaries).  
  - **Pragmatics**: Literal interpretation, poor inferencing, and social challenges.  
- **Theories of Causation**:  
  - **Auditory Processing Deficit** (Tallal, 2003): Difficulty with rapid acoustic signals.  
  - **Surface Hypothesis** (Leonard, 1998): Trouble with low-salience morphemes.  
- **Interventions**:  
  - **Recasting**, **imitation**, and **expansion** drills to reinforce grammar (Proctor-Williams, 2009).  


### Key Comparisons  
| Disorder          | Strengths                 | Deficits                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Williams**      | Vocabulary, narrative     | Abstract concepts, complex syntax |
| **Down Syndrome** | Pragmatics, social skills | Phonology, slow acquisition       |
| **ASD**           | Phonology (articulation)  | Pragmatics, theory of mind        |
| **DLD**           | Normal IQ, hearing        | Morphosyntax, word retrieval      |

**Conclusion**: Atypical language development reflects complex interactions between genetic, cognitive, and social factors. Interventions must be tailored to individual profiles, leveraging relative strengths (e.g., DS pragmatics) while addressing core deficits (e.g., DLD grammar).
