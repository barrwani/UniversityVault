## Relative Clauses

A relative clause is a sentential clause which modifies the head noun of a noun phrase (NP). 
- Essentially an embedded sentence within an NP that creates a complex NP

### Example

- The man $[$who was wearing a hat$]_\text{RC}$$]_\text{NP}$
	- "who was wearing a hat" relative clause, modifying the head noun "man".

## Passive Sentences



## Optional Root Infinitives



## Recursion

Recursion is the ability to iterate syntactic constituents inside constituents. Thought to be one of the fundamental properties of human language.
- Noun phrases inside noun phrases inside noun phrases...
- Sentences within sentences within sentences....


Two types of nominal (relating to nouns) recursion:
- Prepositional Phrase recursion (PP):
	- 1-level: \[The woman \[with \[the dog$]_\text{NP}]_\text{PP}]_\text{NP}$
