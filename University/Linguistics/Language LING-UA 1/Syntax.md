Syntax is the study of sentence formation.

## Syntactic Competence 

Consists of three key factors:
- The ability to judge grammaticality , even if the construction is a rare one
- The ability to recognize a sentence as grammatical, even if it does not "make sense” 
- The ability to determine what a sentence means, whether it is ambiguous or not

#### Ambiguity 

- Lexical ambiguity: "I went to the **bank**"
	- Financial institution or river bank?
- Structural Ambiguity: "I met former producers and extras"
	- Former producers and i met extras
	- Former producers and former extras


## Syntax Structure


>[!note] Parts of a sentence/phrase
>	N - Nouns
>	V - Verbs
>	P - Prepositions
>	Adj - Adjectives
>	Adv - Adverbs
>	Det - Determiner
>	Aux - Auxiliary
>	C - Complementizer


### Constituent Structure

A sentence (S) has two main constituents, labeled Noun Phrase (NP) and Verb Phrase (VP)

The triangle notation is used to indicate that the phrase contains additional structure that we do not want to exhibit at the moment. 

### Noun Phrase (NP)

A noun phrase may consist of:

(Det) + Noun + (PP)

>[!note] Examples
> snow (N)
> some (Det) snow (N)
> snow (N) in the yard (PP)

### Verb Phrase (VP)

A verb phrase consists of:

Verb (V) + (...)

>[!note] Examples
> We (NP) Imagined (V)
> He (NP) Runs (V)
> Swarms (V) With Life (PP)


### Prepositional Phrase (PP)

A prepositional phrase typically consists of:

P + (...)

>[!note] Examples
> along (P)
> out (P) the door (NP)
> along (P) with Mary (PP)

Prepositions include:

- Out
- Along
- With
- From
- Behind

etc..

### Complementizer Phrase (CP)

The subordinate clause or complement clause.

The complementizer (C) turns a sentence in to something that will serve as the complement of a verb. 

>[!note] Examples
> that (C) the earth was flat (S)
> if (C) the governor arrived (S)
> S denotes sentence, typically wont be used


## X-Bar Schema


Specifiers - Heads - Complements.

To assign more articulated structures to phrases, make predictions about what kind of phrases may exist within one language, and discover big cross-linguistic generalisations.

X' : X-Bar


#### Heads
Each phrasal category has a head that determines the syntactic nature of the phrase.

The head is a lexical or functional category.

The head of NP is N, VP is V, etc.

The head cannot be absent, unless its "deleted", as in:

>[!note] Examples
> You ate [two bagels] and Pat ate [three ----].
> You [ate bagels] and Pat [---- chips].

The head X may be accompanied by other phrases within XP, called Specifiers and Complements. 

Compliments are closer to the head than specifiers, and they form a constituent X'

In English, heads precede their complements. 

![[Pasted image 20231009023757.png]]

- Heads will determine if complements are obligatory.
- Heads impose restrictions on their complements:
	- they select particular categories (NP, CP, PP etc.) and often semantic properties (abstract, concrete, etc.)
- Specifiers are mostly optional
- Heads don't tend to impose strong restrictions on specifiers
- A head may have one or more complements

>[!note]
In English, singular count nouns require a determiner (specifier):
"Sue ate bun" vs "Sue ate **a** bun"
>
Otherwise, they usually are optional:
"Sue ate buns" vs "Sue ate **the** buns"

Heads are always small - lexical categories like N, or functional categories like C. 

Complements of a head are always full phrases (XP). Specifiers are also always full phrases, but for this class it isn't necessary to explore that. 

#### Replacing Sentence (S)

The head of a sentence is Tense (T), which hosts the present/past/future tense feature or an auxiliary.

To simplify the process:

- We can omit the intermediate X' level when the head doesn't have both a specifier and a complement (VP-V instead of VP-V'-V)
- We can use triangles when the internal structure of a phrase is not at issue
- Sometimes, we may dispense with T-T'-TP and C-C'-CP and use S= NP + VP instead (if instructions say to)

## Universal Grammar and Head Directionality


Most people have syntactic competence in at least one language. Human language must be both extremely different and similar to each other. 

Different, such that if they weren't foreign languages would be too easily figured out, and similar, such that the same messages can still be conveyed in different distinct languages.

The task of linguists is to develop a way to talk about syntax in such a way that does justice to both the differences and similarities. 

### Chomsky's hypothesis

- The human language faculty
	- Enables humans to acquire and represent language;
	- delimits what linguistic structures humans can acquire and represent in an effortless manner;
	- therefore delimits the kind of linguistics conventions that a community of humans can develop and successfully hand down to new generations
- "Universal Grammar"
	- Hypothesised to be part of all humans' biological endowment;
	- reflected in all natural languages
- The differences in language are systematic, not random
- Universal grammar has parameters that can take different pre-defined values.

### Linguistic Universals

Linguistic universals are the language typologist's term for directly observable regularities.

They take an [[Conditional Statements & Boolean Algebra|implicational form]]:
If a language has a property P, then it also has property Q.

### Word order types

Many universals refer to the word order type of the language in the if-clause of the implication

Word order types in neutral declarative sentences:

S = subject, V = verb, O = object.

SVO languages: English, French, Swahili
VSO languages: fs7a Arabic, Tagalog
SOV Languages: Japanese, Persian, Turkish

The rest are less common.

"Hanako saw Yuki"

SOV: Hanako ga Yuki o mita
Hanako Yuki saw

VSO: Ra'at Hanako Yuki
Saw Hanako Yuki

### Universal Grammar Parameters

"The null subject" parameter:

Can unstressed subject pronouns be silent?

Not in English: (Where did go? Where went?)
Yes in Italian (Dove è andato?)

"The head directionality" parameter:

Do heads precede or follow their complements?

**Head Initial**:

![[Pasted image 20231009033239.png]]

**Head Final**
![[Pasted image 20231009033255.png]]

"The wh-fronting" parameter
Must question words occur at the beginning of the clause?

Yes, one per clause in English (**Who** did Mary introduce to **whom**?)

Yes, all of them in Hungarian (**Kit Kinek** mutatott be Mari?)

No, they stay in place (Mandarin, Hindi, etc...)
