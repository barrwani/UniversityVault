Morphology is the study of word formation. 

### Roots, Stems, Affixes

A morpheme is the smallest **meaningful** unit in language. 

A word can consist of a stem + affix

The stem itself will have one or more morphemes, and the smallest stem is called the root.

For example:

>[!note] Example
>un quench able s : stem = unquenchable, affix = s
>un quench able : stem = quenchable, affix = un
>quench able : stem = quench, affix = able
>quench = root

Affixes can be prefixes or suffixes, or in non-English languages, infixes or circumfixes.

### Types of Morphemes


Roots/stems are **open class** morphemes, meaning new instances can be easily created.

Affixes are **closed class** morphemes, meaning they come from a fixed inventory.

>Basically meaning that in a language, new affixes dont usually get created, whereas new roots/stems come out all the time (like rizz...)

#### Types of affixes

Derivational affixes "create new concepts"

>[!note] Examples
>friend-ship
>un-fold
>predict-ion
>philosoph-er
>moral-ise

Inflectional affixes add grammatical information, e.g. number, person, case, tense, mood, etc.

>[!note] Examples
>-s (walks, 3rd person singular agreement)
>-ed (walked, past tense)
>-ing (walking, present participle)
>-en (eaten, past participle)
>-'s (John's, genitive)
>-s (boys, plural of nouns)

Inflectional affixes contribute at the level of sentences/phrases, but never change the category of the word; they are always productive.

#### Homonymous affixes

When an affix has the same phonological shape, but a different meaning:

>[!note] Examples
>/s/ vs /'s/
-er in mover vs nicer 

#### Allomorph

A morpheme is said to have multiple allomorphs if there is a predictable (rule governed) variation in the morphemes sound shape.

>[!note] Examples
>a book
>an apple


#### Bound and Free Morphemes

Bound morphemes are morphemes that cannot stand on their own. 

Free Morphemes are morphemes that can stand alone with their own meaning

## Cross-Linguistic Variation in Morphological Type

## Synthetic

A synthetic language is **one in which grammatical relationships are expressed by modifications of the form of words**.


#### Fusional

>[!note] Example: Latin
>dom-us
>dom-um
>dom-i
>dom-os
>dom-orum

#### Agglutinative

>[!note] Example: Hungarian
>ház
>ház-at
>ház-nak
>ház-ak 
>ház-ak-at
>ház-ak-nak

The difference between fusional and agglutinative languages is that fusional languages will assign multiple categories of a word/sentence into one morpheme, whereas an agglutinative language will keep each category to its own morpheme. 

#### Templatic

>[!note] Example: Arabic
>kataba
>maktab
>kitab
>mukaataba
>kuttaab
>kutiba
>maktuub

Languages where words are based on a root verb with (usually) systematic restructuring of the word to give it new meaning. 



## Constituent Structure

The formation of words is governed by rules.

The constituent structure of a word reflects the steps in which it is created. Each stage must be a possible word.

The cross-linguistically attested scenario is :

((root + derivational affixes) + inflectional affixes)`

Once an inflectional affix has been attached, no derivational affixes can be attached.


>[!note] Example: English
>Verb + -able = Adjective
>re- + Verb = Verb
>un- + Adjective = Adjective
>un- + Verb = Verb


Words can be structurally ambiguous - formed in two different ways. The two structures may carry different meanings. If so, the word is also semantically ambiguous.
