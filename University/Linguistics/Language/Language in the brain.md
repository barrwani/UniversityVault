## Do animals communicate as we do?

- The difference between animal communication and human communication is the presence of spoken language. 
	- Some animals like chimps can recognise words, but there is no evidence that they have any notion of grammar.
	- The larynxes of animals like chimps and even Neanderthals was very high, so many sounds are not possible. Their tongues were also too high to be able to make the precise motions/positions required for speech.
	- The larynx dropped over time to deepen the voice and ward off predators, with the added benefit of allowing for more room for the tongue which leads to a wider capability of sounds, and thus the possibility for speech. 
	- This came with the drawback of an increased risk of choking, as the epiglottis and soft palate do not form a seal to prevent food from entering the windpipe. 
	- In human babies, the larynx starts out high and gradually lowers 
		- Human speech sounds are impossible before this.

## How much of a language do we learn, and how much of it is built at birth?

- The Surinamese Creole was formed by the children of slaves who used a Pidgin to communicate due to language barriers.

	- The Pidgin had no syntactic/grammatical rules, but when the children learned the language they naturally formed these rules.

- Sign language has its own unique grammar and is uniquely distinct from any other language.

	- When studying deaf students whoâ€™ve never learned any spoken language seem to think in signs
	- They also make similar mistakes as spoken language speaking children
	-  The left hemisphere of the brain processes language, as it is better suited to do so than the right, which processes movement. ASL is also processed by the left hemisphere, which exacerbates this point

- Babies learn to discriminate between different sounds (vowels and moods), implying an innate ability to categorize and understand language.

- The brain is not separated such that language or grammar are localized to one area, but rather a network across the whole brain that together processes language.

## If language is so vital to communicate our thoughts, does it also colour the thoughts we have?
