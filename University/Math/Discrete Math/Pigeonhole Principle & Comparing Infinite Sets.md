## Pigeonhole Principle

Given $n$ objects and $s$ spaces to store them in, if $n > s$, then there are at least two objects that have to share a space. Essentially, there exists at least one space shared by at least two objects. 


## Comparing Infinite Sets

When dealing with the cardinality of infinite sets, we can use the fact that if two sets have the same cardinality provided that there is a bijection $f : A \rightarrow B$ or a one-to-one correspondence in the two sets.

Although it feels counterintuitive, try to rely on one-to-one correspondence when cardinality of infinite sets is involved.
