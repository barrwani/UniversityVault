#### Definitions

A definition is used to specify precisely the concepts in which we are interested.

 - A good definition of a term contains:
	 - The category to which it can apply
	 - The term itself
	 - "Provided" or "if"
	 - The defining characteristics

**For example:**
- Grandmother:
	- Person A is the grandmother of B if she is the mother of one of B's parents.

Avoid **excessive** **reductionism**, some terms must be assumed to be understood:

- Basic sets of numbers and the operations of addition and multiplication 
- $\mathbb{N}$ - Natural Numbers
- $\mathbb{Z}$ - Integers
- $\mathbb{Q}$ - Rational Numbers
- $\mathbb{R}$ - Real Numbers

You don't need to define divisible. 

Important definitions to know:

Even:
$$\text{An integer }a \text{ is even provided that it is divisible by }2$$
Odd:
$$\text{An integer }a \text{ is odd provided that there exists an integer }k \text{ such that } a = 2k+1$$
Prime:
$$\text{A positive integer }p \text{ is prime provided that it is greater than } 1 \text{ and the only positive divisors of }p \text{ are }1 \text{ and }p$$

Composite:
$$\text{A positive integer }a \text{ is called composite provided that there is an integer } b \text{ such that }1<b < a \text{ and } b|a$$

#### Theorem 

A theorem asserts exactly what is true about the concepts discussed within a definition.

It is a mathematical truth, and should be unconditional and without exception (always true).


#### Proofs - irrefutably demonstrate the truth about these assertions


## Examples of Theorems

Theorems are typically in the form of:
$\text{If a, then b}$

#### Pythagoras Theorem:

$\text{If a and b are the lengths of a right triangle and c is the length of the hypotenuse, then:}$
$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$
#### Theorem

$\text{If a function } f(x) \text{ is differentiable at a point, then it is continuous at that point}$
