#### Definitions - specify precisely the concepts in which we are interested


#### Theorem - assert exactly what is true about these concepts


#### Proofs - irrefutably demonstrate the truth about these assertions



## Examples of Theorems

"If a, then b"

#### Pythagoras Theorem:

$\text{If a and b are the lengths of a right triangle and c is the length of the hypotenuse, then:}$
$$
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
$$
#### Theorem

$\text{If a function } f(x) \text{ is differentiable at a point, then it is continuous at that point}$
