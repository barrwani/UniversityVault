Sometimes it's difficult to prove a statement directly, and its easier to prove by contrapositive or using contradictions. 

## Contrapositive

To prove by contrapositive:

- State proof by contrapositive
- Assume (Not B)
- Prove (Not A)

## Contradiction

To prove by contradiction:
- Assume the conditions in A
- Suppose the opposite for B (not B)
- Argue until a contradiction is reached


## Well-Ordering Principle

The well-ordering principle states that every nonempty subset of natural numbers contains a **smallest** element.

This idea can be used in proofs, in particular in proof by contradiction, using the smallest counterexample. 

### Proof By Smallest Counterexample

To prove by smallest counterexample:

- Define the set of counterexamples
- Argue that the set has a smallest number $x$
- $x-1$ is not a counterexample, so result holds for $x-1$ 
	- Verify $x-1$ is a valid number for this result
- Show contradiction for $x$
