_Corelink_
_2024 Fall_
## Background
- Unreal Engine Corelink Plugin that allows for the new version of Corelink to be used via the engine
- Faced many problems over the semesters, Unreal doesn't play well with the current version of Corelink
## Tasks
- Attempt as many different approaches to integrating Corelink into the engine as possible
	- Static linking, dynamic linking, build file modifications, dependency handling variation, etc..
- Once a stable build is produced we publish to the Unreal Marketplace
## Outcome
- None of the attempts succeeded, so a stable build was never produced.
## Next steps
- Move towards rewriting Corelink's C++ Client into an Unreal Engine C++ Client 
	- Using Unreal data structures and adhering to it's standards
